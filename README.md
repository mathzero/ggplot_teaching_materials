# ggplot_teaching_materials
 Class materials for teaching ggplot and other data viz in R. Included:
 
 
 * __GGplot walkthrough:__ create a multi-facet, interactive [volcano plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_plot_(statistics)) using ggplot and plotly. Volcano plots are often used to display the results of multiple statistical tests in omics analysis (genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, etc).
 
 * __Data viz code demo:__ an R script with lots of examples of different types of plot in base R, ggplot, heatmaply, gganimate and plotly. The animated ggplot uses gapminder data and is based on this [excellent tutorial](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/gganimate-how-to-create-plots-with-beautiful-animation-in-r/) by [kassambara](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/author/kassambara/).

The ggplot walkthrough is published as a webpage here: https://mathzero.github.io/ggplot_teaching_materials/#creating_a_multi-facet_volcano_plot
